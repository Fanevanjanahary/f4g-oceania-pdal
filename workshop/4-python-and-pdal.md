# PDAL + python

PDAL can run python code, or be run *as* python code. Why Python? That's a user demand question for it's developers!

In order to make it go, PDAL needs to be compiled with Python bindings. Fortunately that happens already for both Conda and Docker installation. If you're building PDAL from scratch, make sure you include Python.

Python functions can be run as part of a `pipeline` using `filters.python`.


## PDAL as a python library

This is best demonstrated in a Jupyter notebook.
