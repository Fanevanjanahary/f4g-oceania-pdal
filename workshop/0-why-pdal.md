# PDAL and all the other things

Setting out to process point clouds, why would I choose PDAL? What is different from LAStools, or PCL, or libLAS, or LASpy?

My story was ridiculously simple: I needed to process some LAS 1.4 files, had no budget to buy LAStools, and PDAL was there.

PDAL's pipeline functionality was the reason I stayed, along with the emergence of Entwine, a point cloud management approach that is closely integrated with PDAL and provides lossless, visualisation-and-data-query-ready data organisation.

The key design points for PDAL are described here: https://pdal.io/about.html
